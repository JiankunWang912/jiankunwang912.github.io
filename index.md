## About Me

I am currently a final-year M.S. candidate in Computer Science from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), advised by [Prof. Lu Sun](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sunlu/index.html). Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Hohai University](https://en.hhu.edu.cn/). My research interests are in the area of interpretable machine learning. I've been working on **multi-task learning**, **meta-learning** and **personalized learning**.

## Research Experience

- <p style="text-align:left;"><b>Few-shot Personalized Regression</b><span style="float:right;">Jun. 2022 - Present</span></p>
  We focus on the few-shot meta learning problem of personalized regression. In our method, the sample-specific model is supported by inter-task meta-knowledge and intra-task sample correlations. An end-to-end learning framework is proposed to perform feature extraction and personalized modeling for each meta task. 
  
- <p style="text-align:left;"><b>Multi-task Personalized Learning</b><span style="float:right;">Mar. 2021 - May. 2022</span></p>
  
  We perform personalized learning in the multi-task scenarios, which enables to save both homogeneity and heterogeneity of samples. We develop an efficient alternating algorithm achieving SOTA results under 6 multi-task benchmarks. The relevant papers are one accepted by IJCAI22 and one under review.
